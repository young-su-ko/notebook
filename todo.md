### projects
1. implement/train an inverse folding model (structure -> sequence)
2. [meanflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13447)
3. train flow matching model using plm embeddings
4. inpainting model

### concepts/papers
1. floating point operations
2. gvp-gnn
3. discrete walk jump sampling
4. ~~Fr√©chet inception distance~~
5. Imagen
6. KL divergence
7. classifier guidance with non-differentiable
8. clip score (connect to pinal's protrek score)
